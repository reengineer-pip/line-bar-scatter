Univariate Time Series Forecasting - Annual Sales


ðŸ“ˆ 1. Line Plot

What It Is:

A line plot connects data points with a line, usually to show trends over time or a continuous progression.

Best Used For:

* Time-series data (e.g., stock prices, temperature changes, website traffic over days/months).
* Trends or changes over intervals.
* Comparing multiple series over the same x-axis (e.g., comparing sales of different products month by month).

Example Use Case:

* Tracking monthly sales of a product over a year.
* Monitoring temperature changes throughout a day.


ðŸ“Š 2. Bar Plot (Bar Chart)

What It Is:

A bar plot uses rectangular bars to represent values. The height (vertical bars) or length (horizontal bars) of the bar corresponds to the value.

Best Used For:

* Comparing discrete categories (e.g., products, regions, survey responses).
* Showing counts, frequencies, or averages.
* Emphasizing differences between items.

Example Use Case:

* Comparing the number of students in different classes.
* Visualizing survey responses across age groups.


âš« 3. Scatter Plot

What It Is:

A scatter plot displays individual data points on a 2D grid. Each point has an x and y value, and the plot helps visualize the relationship or correlation between the two variables.

Best Used For:

* Finding correlations or patterns between two variables.
* Detecting outliers in data.
* Exploring relationships (positive, negative, or none).

Example Use Case:

* Analyzing the relationship between advertising budget and sales.
* Plotting age vs. income to see if there's a trend.
